APIWizard Online Documentation
----------------------------------

Pro/Web.Link for Creo Parametric 1.0 uses the APIWizard format 
for online documentation. This application contains reference material and
an online copy of the Pro/Web.Link User's Guide.


To Install the Pro/Web.Link APIWizard
-------------------------------------

The Pro/ENGINEER product CD installation procedure automatically 
installs the Pro/Web.Link APIWizard.  APIWizard installation files reside 
in a directory under the Creo load point. The location for the 
embedded browser-based Pro/Web.Link APIWizard files is:

<creo_loadpoint>/Common Files/weblink/weblinkdoc

To manually install the APIWizard to a different directory, copy all files 
and subdirectories in and under:

<creo_loadpoint>/Common Files/weblink/weblinkdoc

to the desired location.

To Run the APIWizard Online Documents
-------------------------------------

Start the Pro/Web.Link APIWizard by pointing your browser to:

<creo_loadpoint>/Common Files/weblink/weblinkdoc/index.html

Your web browser will display the Pro/Web.Link APIWizard data.  It may take 
up to several minutes to load the application. As the APIWizard loads, 
it will provide diagnostics and assist you with setting up the proper
environment for the APIWizard.   

To use the APIWizard
--------------------

See the chapter titled "The Pro/Web.Link Online Browser" in the APIWizard.  To 
locate this chapter:
 +  select "Pro/Web.Link Wildfire User's Guide" from the pulldown menu just 
     above the tree on the left side of the browser.  
 +  select "The Pro/Web.Link Online Browser" from the tree.
